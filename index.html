        <div class="sentence">In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been
            turning
            over in my mind ever since.</div>
        <div class="sentence">“Whenever you feel like criticising any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the
            people
            in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”</div>


        <div class="sentence">He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way,
            and
            I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all
            judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few
            veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
            normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I
            was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I
            have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile

            </div> when I realised by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon;

            </div> and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a
            little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly
            repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.

        <div class="sentence">And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.
            Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s
            founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and
            at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous 4 excursions with privileged glimpses into
            the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby,
            who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of
            successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the
            promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
            thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby

            </div> which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for
            hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall
            ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
            floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and
            shortwinded elations of men.

        <div class="sentence">My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three
            generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from
            the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in
            fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my
            father carries on to-day.</div>


        <div class="sentence">I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him — with special reference

            just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed

            restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge
            of the universe — so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond
            business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as
            if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant
            faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I
            thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
